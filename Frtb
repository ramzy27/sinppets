in FRTB context we want to dispaly HPL Pnl and other Pnl measures to analyst. There is a bigQuery table for each rolldate that contains the instrumentIdentifier , the portoflio, the hmsBook ,the currency and several PnL measures columns.The user interface contains virtual portfolio filter,date filter and search button , when hit it will dispaly the Pnl data in angular ag grid that is coming from bigQuery.the server side api is implemented with spring. should the data be paginated ?
Whether or not the data should be paginated depends on the specific requirements of your application and the amount of data that will be displayed.

Pagination can be useful when displaying a large amount of data, as it allows users to view the data in smaller chunks rather than having to scroll through a potentially very long list. This can improve the performance of the application and make it easier for users to find the information they need.

However, there are also cases where pagination may not be necessary, such as if the amount of data being displayed is relatively small or if the data is able to be efficiently filtered using other mechanisms.

In addition to pagination, you can also consider other ways to improve the performance and usability of your application such as allowing users to sort or filter the data, or using lazy loading to only load the data that is currently being displayed.

It's also important to keep security in mind and make sure that any sensitive data is properly protected and that users only have access to the data they are authorized to see.

there are more thant 400000 rows for each date
Displaying more than 400,000 rows of data on a single page could cause performance issues for both the server and the client. It might be slow to load, and it would also take a lot of memory on the client side.

In this case, it would be a good idea to implement pagination to allow users to view the data in smaller chunks. This would reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded at one time and make the application more responsive.

You can set a specific number of rows to be displayed per page, such as 100, 250 or 1000, depending on the specific requirements of the application and what makes sense for the data. Additionally, you can allow the user to select the number of rows per page to see, or you can use an “infinite scrolling” technique in order to load new pages as the user scrolls down, this way, only a few pages are loaded at a time.

You also might want to consider additional ways to filter or sort the data, in order to help users quickly find the information they need.

It's also important to take into consideration the time and cost of querying the data, if you have a high read traffic and high cost of running these queries in BigQuery, you could consider using caching or denormalizing the data, in order to improve performance while keeping the cost of running the queries down.

we have a virtual portfolio hierarchy. a risk portfolio in java has 4 fields : String portfolioId, Integer code, Map<String,RiskPortfolio> childMap, Map<String,RisPortfolio>parentMap . when the code is 0 that means that is just a virtual portfolio and when then the code is not 0 that means that is related to a real sophis portfolio. can you give an example of java class implementation of that
Sure, here's an example of a Java class that implements a virtual portfolio hierarchy with a RiskPortfolio class:

Copy code
import java.util.Map;

public class RiskPortfolio {
    private String portfolioId;
    private Integer code;
    private Map<String, RiskPortfolio> childMap;
    private Map<String, RiskPortfolio> parentMap;

    public RiskPortfolio(String portfolioId, Integer code) {
        this.portfolioId = portfolioId;
        this.code = code;
    }

    public String getPortfolioId() {
        return portfolioId;
    }

    public void setPortfolioId(String portfolioId) {
        this.portfolioId = portfolioId;
    }

    public Integer getCode() {
        return code;
    }

    public void setCode(Integer code) {
        this.code = code;
    }

    public Map<String, RiskPortfolio> getChildMap() {
        return childMap;
    }

    public void setChildMap(Map<String, RiskPortfolio> childMap) {
        this.childMap = childMap;
    }

    public Map<String, RiskPortfolio> getParentMap() {
        return parentMap;
    }

    public void setParentMap(Map<String, RiskPortfolio> parentMap) {
        this.parentMap = parentMap;
    }

    public boolean isVirtual() {
        return code == 0;
    }

    public void addChild(RiskPortfolio child) {
        childMap.put(child.getPortfolioId(), child);
    }

    public void addParent(RiskPortfolio parent) {
        parentMap.put(parent.getPortfolioId(), parent);
    }

    public boolean isRoot() {
        return parentMap.isEmpty();
    }
}
The RiskPortfolio class has four fields:

portfolioId: a string representing the unique identifier of the portfolio.
code: an integer representing the code of the portfolio, where 0 means it's a virtual portfolio and any other value means it's a real Sophis portfolio.
childMap: a map that holds the child portfolios of the portfolio, with the key being the portfolioId of the child and the value being the RiskPortfolio object.
parentMap: a map that holds the parent portfolios of the portfolio, with the key being the portfolioId of the parent and the value being the RiskPortfolio object.
The class also has several methods that provide additional functionality:

isVirtual(): returns true if the portfolio's code is 0, indicating that it's a virtual portfolio.
addChild(RiskPortfolio child): adds a child portfolio to the childMap.
addParent(RiskPortfolio parent): adds a parent portfolio to the parentMap.
isRoot(): returns true if the portfolio doesn't have any parents, indicating that it's a root portfolio.
You could use this class to represent a virtual portfolio hierarchy, and use the fields and methods provided to navigate and manipulate the hierarchy as needed.

You can then use this class to create instances of virtual and real portfolios and then add the parent-child relationships and check the portfolio nature, with other methods provided by the class.

the virtual portfolios are loaded in cache and displayed to user interface. The user should select a virtual portfolio in his query , how can we in the java server side map this virtual portfolio to all the real sophis portfolios and adapt the BigQuery query?
There are several ways to map a virtual portfolio to all the real Sophis portfolios in your Java server-side code. One approach could be to use the childMap and parentMap fields of the RiskPortfolio class to traverse the virtual portfolio hierarchy and collect all the real Sophis portfolios that are associated with the selected virtual portfolio.

Here's an example of how you could achieve this:

Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class PortfolioMapper {

    public static List<String> getRealPortfolios(RiskPortfolio virtualPortfolio) {
        List<String> realPortfolios = new ArrayList<>();
        getRealPortfolios(virtualPortfolio, realPortfolios);
        return realPortfolios;
    }

    private static void getRealPortfolios(RiskPortfolio virtualPortfolio, List<String> realPortfolios) {
        if (!virtualPortfolio.isVirtual()) {
            realPortfolios.add(virtualPortfolio.getPortfolioId());
        } else {
            for (RiskPortfolio child : virtualPortfolio.getChildMap().values()) {
                getRealPortfolios(child, realPortfolios);
            }
        }
    }
}
You can call PortfolioMapper.getRealPortfolios(virtualPortfolio) passing the virtual portfolio selected by the user and get a List of real portfolios.

You can then use this list to modify your BigQuery query in order to filter the results to only include data for the real portfolios associated with the selected virtual portfolio. For example, you could add a clause to your query's WHERE clause, like this:

Copy code
WHERE portfolioId IN (list_of_real_portfolios)
You can replace 'list_of_real_portfolios' with a string formed by the concatenation of the elements of the List of real portfolios previously obtained.

It's important to note that you should take care of the correct format of the parameter of the IN clause, as well as the performance of this approach.

Another approach that you can use is to store the virtual-real portfolio relationships in a separate table in BigQuery and joining this table with the main table in the query.

It's also possible to store these relationships in the form of parent-child relationships in BigQuery and use the tree traversal functions to go through the hierarchy, this way you don't have to go through a recursion in your code and this logic can be kept in the SQL query.

let's first consider the first approach , when i get the results back from BigQuery I want to resolve the portfolio and the parent portfolio from the portfolios hierarchy map stored in cache and i want to send the portfolio Id and parentPortfolioId so that I can group the results by portfolio hierarchy using ag grid tree map . How can I resolve the portfolioId and the parentPortfolioId which needs to be under or equals to the portfolio Passed in the user request?
To resolve the portfolio and parent portfolio from the portfolios hierarchy map stored in cache, you can create a helper method that takes in the portfolioId from the results returned from BigQuery, and the virtual portfolio passed in the user request, and returns the corresponding portfolio and parent portfolio from the cache. Here's an example:

Copy code
import java.util.Optional;

public class PortfolioResolver {
    private final RiskPortfolio virtualPortfolio;

    public PortfolioResolver(RiskPortfolio virtualPortfolio) {
        this.virtualPortfolio = virtualPortfolio;
    }

    public PortfolioHierarchy resolve(String portfolioId) {
        RiskPortfolio portfolio = findPortfolio(portfolioId);
        RiskPortfolio parentPortfolio = findParentPortfolio(portfolio);
        return new PortfolioHierarchy(portfolio.getPortfolioId(), parentPortfolio.getPortfolioId());
    }

    private RiskPortfolio findPortfolio(String portfolioId) {
        RiskPortfolio current = virtualPortfolio;
        while (!current.getPortfolioId().equals(portfolioId)) {
            Optional<RiskPortfolio> match = current.getChildMap().values().stream()
                .filter(child -> child.getPortfolioId().equals(portfolioId))
                .findFirst();
            if (match.isPresent()) {
                current = match.get();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid portfolioId: " + portfolioId);
            }
        }
        return current;
    }

    private RiskPortfolio findParentPortfolio(RiskPortfolio child) {
        RiskPortfolio current = child;
        while (!current.isRoot()) {
            current = current.getParentMap().values().iterator().next();
        }
        return current;
    }
}
This class accepts a virtual portfolio passed by the user request. The method resolve(portfolioId) takes the portfolioId from the BigQuery results and returns an object PortfolioHierarchy that contains the portfolioId and parentPortfolioId.

In this example, the method findPortfolio(portfolioId) goes through the childMap of the virtual portfolio passed in the user request, to find the portfolio that matches the given portfolioId.
The method findParentPortfolio(RiskPortfolio child) goes through the parentMap of a given portfolio, until it finds the root, that means that it reached the parent of the virtual portfolio passed by the user request.

Then, you can use this class to resolve the portfolio and parent portfolio for each result returned from BigQuery, and group the results by portfolio hierarchy using ag grid tree map.

It's important to notice that the above example assumes that there is only one parent for each portfolio, and if this is not the case you might have to adjust the findParentPortfolio method to handle the case with multiple parents.

How can I resolve the portfolioId and the parentPortfolioId which needs to be under or equals to the portfolio Passed in the user request?
To resolve the portfolio and parent portfolio from the portfolios hierarchy map stored in cache that are under or equals to the portfolio passed in the user request, you can use a helper method that takes in the portfolioId from the results returned from BigQuery, and the virtual portfolio passed in the user request, and returns the corresponding portfolio and parent portfolio from the cache.

One way to approach this is to add a new helper method that traverses the hierarchy using recursion, starting from the virtual portfolio passed in the user request. Here's an example:

Copy code
    public PortfolioHierarchy resolveUnderOrEquals(String portfolioId) {
        RiskPortfolio portfolio = findPortfolioUnderOrEquals(portfolioId, virtualPortfolio);
        RiskPortfolio parentPortfolio = findParentPortfolio(portfolio);
        return new PortfolioHierarchy(portfolio.getPortfolioId(), parentPortfolio.getPortfolioId());
    }
    
    private RiskPortfolio findPortfolioUnderOrEquals(String portfolioId, RiskPortfolio current) {
        if(current.getPortfolioId().equals(portfolioId)){
            return current;
        }
        for (RiskPortfolio child : current.getChildMap().values()) {
            RiskPortfolio result = findPortfolioUnderOrEquals(portfolioId, child);
            if(result != null){
                return result;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
This will search the child and child's child recursively till it find the portfolio that match the given portfolioId or the virtual portfolio passed in the user request. The method findParentPortfolio(RiskPortfolio child) remains the same as the previous implementation.

Then, you can use this class to resolve the portfolio and parent portfolio for each result returned from BigQuery, and group the results by portfolio hierarchy using ag grid tree map.

It's important to notice that this approach can be more resource intensive, especially if the virtual portfolio hierarchy is deep, and the cache does not have the whole hierarchy.

Another approach could be to store the virtual-real portfolio relationships in a separate table in BigQuery and joining this table with the main table in the query, but then you'll have to match the passed virtual portfolio id with the real portfolio id in the table, and you might have to go through all the results to find the virtual-real portfolio relationship, which can also be resource intensive.

can you modify the code , we are recieving the code of portfolio and not the portfolioId from biQuery
Sure, if you're receiving the code of the portfolio instead of the portfolioId from BigQuery, you can modify the PortfolioResolver class accordingly. Here's an example:

Copy code
public class PortfolioResolver {
    private final RiskPortfolio virtualPortfolio;

    public PortfolioResolver(RiskPortfolio virtualPortfolio) {
        this.virtualPortfolio = virtualPortfolio;
    }

    public PortfolioHierarchy resolve(Integer code) {
        RiskPortfolio portfolio = findPortfolio(code);
        RiskPortfolio parentPortfolio = findParentPortfolio(portfolio);
        return new PortfolioHierarchy(portfolio.getPortfolioId(), parentPortfolio.getPortfolioId());
    }

    private RiskPortfolio findPortfolio(Integer code) {
        RiskPortfolio current = virtualPortfolio;
        while (current.getCode() != code) {
            Optional<RiskPortfolio> match = current.getChildMap().values().stream()
                .filter(child -> child.getCode().equals(code))
                .findFirst();
            if (match.isPresent()) {
                current = match.get();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid code: " + code);
            }
        }
        return current;
    }
    private RiskPortfolio findParentPortfolio(RiskPortfolio child) {
        RiskPortfolio current = child;
        while (!current.isRoot()) {
            current = current.getParentMap().values().iterator().next();
        }
        return current;
    }
}
In this example, the method findPortfolio(code) goes through the childMap of the virtual portfolio passed in the user request, and compares the child portfolio's code field with the code argument passed to the method.
The method findParentPortfolio(RiskPortfolio child) remains the same as the previous implementation.

You can use this modified class in the same way you did before, calling `

now that I have portfolioId and parentPortfolioId in my DTO how to display the data grouped by Portfolio respecting the hierarchy. the user should be able to collapse the virtual portolio each time to display the childrens...
Once you have the portfolioId and parentPortfolioId for each result returned from BigQuery, you can use ag-grid's tree data feature to group and display the data by portfolio hierarchy. This can be done by setting the rowGroup and autoGroupColumnDef properties on the grid options, and providing a getDataPath callback function that returns the path to the parent portfolio for each data item.

Here is an example of how you could set up ag-grid to display the data grouped by portfolio hierarchy:

Copy code
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        // columns definitions here
    ],
    rowData: resultsFromBigQuery,
    defaultColDef: {
        // default column definition here
    },
    // enable row grouping
    rowGroup: true,
    // set the column to group by
    autoGroupColumnDef: { field: 'portfolioId' },
    // provide a callback function to get the data path for each item
    getDataPath: (data) => {
        return data.parentPortfolioId + '/' + data.portfolioId;
    },
    // define the groups rendering 
    groupDefaultExpanded: -1, //all groups are closed
    groupIncludeFooter: true,
};

const grid = new agGrid.Grid(gridOptions);
This will group the data by the portfolioId field and display the hierarchy of parent and child portfolios. The getDataPath callback function takes in a data item and returns its path within the hierarchy in the format of parentPortfolioId/portfolioId. This path is then used by ag-grid to determine the parent-child relationship between the items. The gridOptions groupDefaultExpanded sets all the group nodes are closed by default.

The grid will now display the groupings as tree structure, and the user will be able to expand and collapse the virtual portfolios to show the children.

You could also add an option to the grid to allow the

I got a ts compiler error. Type '(data: any) =>string' is not assignable to type 'GetDataPath'. Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'string[]'
I apologize for the confusion, the getDataPath callback function that I provided in my previous response is not correctly typed for use with ag-grid in TypeScript.

The getDataPath callback function needs to return an array of strings, where each string represents a level in the hierarchy. In this case, each string should be either the portfolioId or the parentPortfolioId.

Here's an example of a correctly typed getDataPath callback function:

Copy code
getDataPath: (data: any) => {
    return [data.parentPortfolioId, data.portfolioId];
},
This will group the data by the portfolioId field, and display the hierarchy of parent and child portfolios.

You should also check that the imported types of ag-grid are the correct ones, they should be imported from "@ag-grid-community/all-modules" or "@ag-grid-enterprise/all-modules" instead of the core.

Also, it could be also useful to set the property groupMultiAutoColumn to true, this way the name of the portfolioId and parentPortfolioId will be visible on the grid, and you can click on the name to expand or collapse the groups.




Ramzi S
there is only one row displayed for each child folio 
If you are only seeing one row displayed for each child portfolio, it's likely that the data is not being correctly grouped by the portfolioId field. This could be caused by a few different factors:

The portfolioId field might not be unique across all the data items. Make sure that each item in the resultsFromBigQuery has a unique portfolioId value.
The getDataPath callback function might not be returning the correct hierarchy. Double check that the callback function is returning the correct parentPortfolioId and portfolioId values for each data item.
The data could be missing the parentPortfolioId. Make sure the data contains the parentPortfolioId of the portfolio, it is necessary for ag-grid to link the child to its parent.
You can debug this by setting a breakpoint inside the getDataPath callback and check the result of the path, or also by setting a breakpoint in ag-grid's internal code.

If you are still having trouble getting the data to display correctly, please provide more details about the data structure and how it is returned from the BigQuery so I can assist you further.

Also, you can check if the grid is correctly grouping the data by checking the grid's API and check the groups values and the children rows.

It could also be that you are displaying all the data, but you don't have the same columns on the data that you are displaying on the grid, in this case, you might be missing some column data, or have extra data that you don't need.




Ramzi S
the console is showing duplicate group keys for row data, keys should be unique
If the console is showing duplicate group keys for the row data, it means that ag-grid is encountering multiple data items with the same group key, and it's not able to correctly group the data. The group keys should be unique, and the duplicate keys are likely the cause of the issue you're experiencing.

Here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot the issue:

Verify that the data returned from BigQuery does not contain duplicate keys. You could check this by counting the number of rows in BigQuery results set, compared to the amount of rows displayed by ag-grid,
Make sure that the getDataPath callback function is returning unique keys for each data item. If two or more items have the same parentPortfolioId and portfolioId value, ag-grid will consider them to be in the same group.
Check that the virtual portfolio passed in the user request corresponds to the virtual portfolio hierarchy in the cache and that the cache is up-to-date.
Verify that all the data passed to ag-grid are of the same type, this could cause the keys to be seen as duplicate.
Finally, make sure the grid is not being reconfigured after the data is loaded, which will cause the duplicate keys.
It would be helpful if you could share the structure of the data and the query you are using to retrieve the data.

You could also, try removing the duplicate keys by using a Set<string> to store the keys and only use the keys stored in the set, this way if you have duplicate keys they will only be stored once.




Ramzi S
i'm not expecting to have unique portfolioId and parentPortfolioId , we should be able to collapse the portfolioId if it has many items with same portfoliId
I apologize for the confusion, you're correct that the portfolioId and parentPortfolioId may not be unique across all the data items, and that the user should be able to collapse the portfolioId if it has many items with the same portfolioId.

In this case, to group the data correctly and display it hierarchically, you need to make sure that the getDataPath callback function is returning a unique path for each data item, based on its portfolioId and parentPortfolioId.

One way to do this is to use the portfolioId and parentPortfolioId concatenated with a separator in the getDataPath callback function.

Copy code
getDataPath: (data) => {
    return data.parentPortfolioId + '#' + data.portfolioId;
},
By doing this, ag-grid will recognize the different elements that share the same portfolioId as different groups, since they have different path.

You should also make sure that the autoGroupColumnDef property is set correctly, it should use the column that has the portfolioId.

Copy code
autoGroupColumnDef: { field: 'portfolioId' },
It's also important that the data passed to ag-grid is correctly ordered, following the parent-child hierarchy, so the grid can group them correctly.

Please let me know if this solves the problem or if you have any other questions.

Ramzi S
but the user should be able to collapse the portfolioId if it has many items with the same portfolioId.
Yes, that's correct. The user should be able to collapse the portfolioId if it has many items with the same portfolioId. To achieve this you can use the grid's APIs to set the group nodes to be collapsible by default. You could set the grid option groupDefaultExpanded to -1, so all groups are closed by default.

Copy code
const gridOptions = {
    // ...
    // enable row grouping
    rowGroup: true,
    // set the column to group by
    autoGroupColumnDef: { field: 'portfolioId' },
    // ...
    // define the groups rendering 
    groupDefaultExpanded: -1, //all groups are closed by default
    // ...
};
This will allow the user to expand or collapse the groups by clicking on the group header, and show or hide the children rows of each group.

You can also use the grid API to programmatically expand and collapse the group, this way, you can set some logic in your application to expand or collapse the group based on certain conditions.

Please let me know if this helps or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.

Let's Say the server side IS implemented using pagination.the returned result IS page of Map<string,string> it's a custom Spring page with an additional array that contains columns name.how to implement the pagination in AG grid and how to add grouping by hmsBook and sumAggregation of all pnl measures in both client and server side
If the server-side is implemented using pagination, you can easily implement pagination in ag-grid by setting the grid's pagination property to true, and configuring the pagination options such as the page size. Here's an example of how you can enable pagination in ag-grid:

Copy code
const gridOptions = {
    // ...
    pagination: true,
    paginationPageSize: 50,
    // ...
};
This will enable pagination on the grid, and set the page size to 50 items per page.

To add grouping by hmsBook and sum aggregation of all PnL measures in both client and server-side, you can use ag-grid's built-in grouping and aggregation features.

On the server-side you can use the pagination API in your query to retrieve the data in pages and group the results by hmsBook and sum the PnL measures.

On the client-side, you can use ag-grid's rowGroup and autoGroupColumnDef properties to group the data by hmsBook, and the columnDefs property to define the columns, including the PnL measures columns, that you want to aggregate. The valueGetter property of the PnL measure columns can be used to specify a function to calculate the sum of the PnL measures.

Here's an example of how you could set up the grid to group by hmsBook and sum the PnL measures:

Copy code
const gridOptions = {
    // ...
    columnDefs: [
        {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'},
        {headerName: 'Instrument Identifier', field: 'instrumentIdentifier'},
        {headerName: 'PNL', field: 'pnl', valueGetter: (params) => {
            return params.data.pnl1 + params.data.pnl2 + params.data.pnl3;
        }},
    ],
    rowData: resultsFromServer,
    // enable row grouping
    rowGroup: true,
    // set the column to group by
    autoGroupColumnDef: { field: 'hmsBook' },
    // ...
};
In this

Let's Say the server side IS implemented using pagination.the returned result IS page of Map<string,string> it's a custom Spring page with an additional array that contains columns name.how to implement the pagination in AG grid and how to add grouping by hmsBook and sumAggregation of all pnl measures in both client and server side
If the server-side is returning a page of data as a Page<Map<string, string>> and an additional array that contains the column names, you can still implement pagination in ag-grid and add grouping by hmsBook and sum aggregation of all PnL measures.

On the client-side, you can use the pagination and paginationPageSize properties of the grid options to enable pagination and set the page size. You can also use the rowGroup and autoGroupColumnDef properties to group the data by hmsBook, and the columnDefs property to define the columns, including the PnL measures columns, that you want to aggregate.

You can use the grid's API to handle the pagination, for example api.paginationGoToPage(pageNumber), or the grid's events such as onPaginationChanged to handle the pagination changes, and call the server with the correct page number.

Regarding the server-side, you will have to map the Map<string,string> to your custom DTO that has the correct fields, and use the column names array to match the fields with the correct values.

To perform the sum aggregation of the PnL measures, you could use a SQL query to perform the sum aggregation on the server-side before returning the page of data, or you could use the valueGetter property of the PnL measure columns on the client-side to calculate the sum of the PnL measures.

It's important to keep in mind that for large data sets, it might be more efficient to perform the aggregation on the server-side, as it will reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred to the client.

Can you  give an example of implémentation in the server with example of the controller , the service and the query

First, you would need to create a controller that handles the pagination requests from the client. Here's an example of a PnLController that exposes an endpoint to retrieve a page of data:

Copy code
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/pnl")
public class PnLController {

    private final PnLService pnlService;

    @Autowired
    public PnLController(PnLService pnlService) {
        this.pnlService = pnlService;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public Page<PnLDTO> getPnL(@RequestParam(value = "page", defaultValue = "0") int page,
                              @RequestParam(value = "size", defaultValue = "50") int size,
                              @RequestParam(value = "hmsBook", required = false) String hmsBook) {
        return pnlService.getPnL(page, size, hmsBook);
    }
}
This controller defines an endpoint that accepts page and size query parameters for pagination, and an optional hmsBook query parameter to filter the data by hmsBook.

Next, you would need to create a service that implements the logic to retrieve the data from the database and perform the pagination, grouping and aggregation. Here's an example of a PnLService that retrieves data from the database using a JpaRepository:

Copy code
@Service
public class PnLService {

    private final PnLRepository pnlRepository;

    @Autowired

It's a Bigquery storage
Alright, if you are using BigQuery for storage, you can still use Spring Data to interact with BigQuery and perform pagination, grouping, and aggregation.

Here's an example of a PnLService that retrieves data from BigQuery and performs pagination, grouping, and aggregation:

Copy code
@Service
public class PnLService {

    private final BigQuery bigQuery;

    @Autowired
    public PnLService(BigQuery bigQuery) {
        this.bigQuery = bigQuery;
    }

    public Page<PnLDTO> getPnL(int page, int size, String hmsBook) {
        String query = "SELECT hmsBook, SUM(pnl1) as pnl1, SUM(pnl2) as pnl2, SUM(pnl3) as pnl3 "
                      + "FROM `your-project.your-dataset.your-table` ";
        if (hmsBook != null) {
            query += "WHERE hmsBook = '" + hmsBook + "' ";
        }
        query += "GROUP BY hmsBook "
                + "ORDER BY hmsBook "
                + "LIMIT " + size + " "
                + "OFFSET " + page * size;
        QueryJobConfiguration queryConfig = QueryJobConfiguration.newBuilder(query).build();
        Page<PnLDTO> result = new Page<>();
        try {
            TableResult tableResult = bigQuery.query(queryConfig);
            List<PnLDTO> data = new ArrayList<>();
            for (FieldValueList row : tableResult.iterateAll()) {
                PnLDTO pnl = new PnLDTO();
                pnl.setHmsBook(row.get("hmsBook").getStringValue());
                pnl.setPnl1(row.get("pnl1").getDoubleValue());
                pnl.setPnl2(row.get("pnl2").getDoubleValue());
                pnl.setPnl3(row.get("pnl3").getDoubleValue());
                data.add(pnl);
            }
            result.setData(data);
            result.setPageNumber(page);
            result.setPageSize(size);
            result.setTotalElements(tableResult.getTotalRows());
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return result;
    }
}
This service uses the BigQuery Java client library to execute a SQL query that performs pagination using the `LIM

Please use the pagination provided by Bigquery 
Sure, BigQuery supports pagination using the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses in the query.

Here's an example of how you could implement pagination in the PnLService using the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses in the query:

Copy code
@Service
public class PnLService {

    private final BigQuery bigQuery;

    @Autowired
    public PnLService(BigQuery bigQuery) {
        this.bigQuery = bigQuery;
    }

    public Page<PnLDTO> getPnL(int page, int size, String hmsBook) {
        String query = "SELECT hmsBook, SUM(pnl1) as pnl1, SUM(pnl2) as pnl2, SUM(pnl3) as pnl3 "
                      + "FROM `your-project.your-dataset.your-table` ";
        if (hmsBook != null) {
            query += "WHERE hmsBook = '" + hmsBook + "' ";
        }
        query += "GROUP BY hmsBook "
                + "ORDER BY hmsBook "
                + "LIMIT " + size + " "
                + "OFFSET " + page * size;
        QueryJobConfiguration queryConfig = QueryJobConfiguration.newBuilder(query).build();

Ok now Can you give the implémentation of client side using AG grid entreprise and angular
Sure! Here's an example of how you might implement pagination, grouping by hmsBook, and sum aggregation of all PnL measures on the client-side using ag-grid enterprise and Angular:

First, you would need to install the ag-grid enterprise package for Angular by running npm install --save ag-grid-enterprise.

Then, you can import the ag-grid modules in your component and configure the grid options:

Copy code
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { GridOptions } from 'ag-grid-community';
import 'ag-grid-enterprise';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: `
    <ag-grid-angular
        #agGrid
        style="width: 100%; height: 600px;"
        class="ag-theme-alpine"
        [gridOptions]="gridOptions"
        [rowData]="rowData"
        [columnDefs]="columnDefs"
        [pagination]="true"
        [paginationPageSize]="pageSize"
        (gridReady)="onGridReady($event)"
        >
    </ag-grid-angular>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
    gridOptions: GridOptions;
    columnDefs;
    rowData;
    pageSize = 50;
    currentPage = 0;

    constructor(private pnlService: PnLService) {
        this.gridOptions = <GridOptions>{};
        this.columnDefs = [
            {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'},
            {headerName: 'PNL', field: 'pnl', valueGetter: (params) => {
                return params.data.pnl1 + params.data.pnl2 + params.data.pnl3;
            }},
        ];
    }

    onGridReady(params) {
        this.pnlService.getPnL(



Ramzi S
can you continue the code
Sure, here's how you can continue the onGridReady method to handle the pagination and load the data from the server:

Copy code
onGridReady(params) {
    this.pnlService.getPnL(this.currentPage, this.pageSize).subscribe(data => {
        this.rowData = data;
        params.api.setRowData(this.rowData);
    });

    params.api.paginationGoToPage(this.currentPage);
    params.api.setServerSideDatasource({
        getRows: (params) => {
            this.currentPage = params.request.endRow / this.pageSize;
            this.pnlService.getPnL(this.currentPage, this.pageSize).subscribe(data => {
                params.successCallback(data);
            });
        }
    });
}
This code uses the paginationGoToPage method of the grid API to set the current page and the setServerSideDatasource method to handle the server-side pagination. The getRows function is passed to setServerSideDatasource method as a callback and it will be called each time the user changes the page, it calls the service to load the data from the server and passes the data to the grid using the successCallback method of the params object.

In order to group the data by hmsBook you can use the autoGroupColumnDef property of the gridOptions object and set the field property to hmsBook.

Copy code
this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'};
And to aggregate the Pnl measures you can set the colDef property valueGetter that returns the sum of Pnl measures.

You can also use the ag-grid api method api.setSortModel and api.setFilterModel on the gridReady event to apply the sort and filter model provided by the user before the first call.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this implementation.




Ramzi S
the grid should be displayed when the user hit Diplay Pnl button this will return data paginated but not aggregated when het hits 'Display Pnl Hms' the ag grid will display the data aggregated by HmsBook
Yes, you can implement that behavior by adding a button to your template and handling the button click event in your component.

Here's an example of how you might add a button to your template and handle the button click event to load the data in the grid:

Copy code
<button (click)="loadData()">Display PnL</button>
<button (click)="loadAggregatedData()">Display PnL by HMS Book</button>

<ag-grid-angular
    #agGrid
    style="width: 100%; height: 600px;"
    class="ag-theme-alpine"
    [gridOptions]="gridOptions"
    [columnDefs]="columnDefs"
    [pagination]="true"
    [paginationPageSize]="pageSize"
    (gridReady)="onGridReady($event)"
    >
</ag-grid-angular>
And in your component, you can have two methods loadData() and loadAggregatedData() that will handle the button click event.

Copy code
loadData() {
    this.pnlService.getPnL(this.currentPage, this.pageSize).subscribe(data => {
        this.rowData = data;
        this.gridOptions.api.setRowData(this.rowData);
        this.gridOptions.api.setSortModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = null;
    });
}

loadAggregatedData() {
    this.pnlService.getAggregatedPnL(this.currentPage, this.pageSize).subscribe(data => {
        this.rowData = data;
        this.gridOptions.api.setRowData(this.rowData);
        this.gridOptions.api.setSortModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'};
    });
}
In loadData method you are calling the service to get the data and you can set the data to the grid, and also you can set the grid sort and filter model to null and set autoGroupColumnDef to null.

And in loadAggregatedData method you are calling the service to get the aggregated data and you can set the data to the grid, and also you can set the grid sort and filter model to




Ramzi S
I don't want to depend on service on my grid component . The results should be displayed using Selectors and the button just trigger store.dispatch
Yes, you can use selectors to retrieve the data from the store and display it in the grid, and use the store.dispatch method to trigger an action that updates the data in the store.

Here's an example of how you might implement this using the ngrx library:

Create a selector that retrieves the data from the store:

Copy code
import { createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';

export const selectPnl = state => state.pnl;

export const selectPaginatedPnl = createSelector(
    selectPnl,
    pnl => pnl.data
);

export const selectAggregatedPnl = createSelector(
    selectPnl,
    pnl => pnl.aggregatedData
);
In your component, you can use the selectors to retrieve the data from the store and display it in the grid:

Copy code
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { GridOptions } from 'ag-grid-community';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { selectPaginatedPnl, selectAggregatedPnl } from './store/selectors/pnl.selectors';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: `
    <button (click)="loadData()">Display PnL</button>
    <button (click)="loadAggregatedData()">Display PnL by HMS Book</button>

    <ag-grid-angular
        #agGrid
        style="width: 100%; height: 600px



Ramzi S
continue
Sure, here is how you can continue the code of the component:

Copy code
    constructor(private store: Store) {
        this.gridOptions = <GridOptions>{};
        this.columnDefs = [
            {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'},
            {headerName: 'PNL', field: 'pnl', valueGetter: (params) => {
                return params.data.pnl1 + params.data.pnl2 + params.data.pnl3;
            }},
        ];
    }

    ngOnInit() {
        this.store.select(selectPaginatedPnl).subscribe(data => {
            this.rowData = data;
            this.gridOptions.api.setRowData(this.rowData);
        });

        this.store.select(selectAggregatedPnl).subscribe(data => {
            this.aggregatedRowData = data;
        });
    }

    loadData() {
        this.store.dispatch(new LoadPnlData());
        this.gridOptions.api.setSortModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = null;
    }

    loadAggregatedData() {
        this.store.dispatch(new LoadAggregatedPnlData());
        this.gridOptions.api.setSortModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);
        this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'};
    }
In this example, I am using the store.select method to subscribe to the data from the store, and then set the data to the grid using the grid's API.
Also, you can use the store.dispatch method to dispatch an action that loads the data from the server and updates the store with the new data.
Also, you can use the ag-grid api method api.setSortModel and api.setFilterModel to set these models to null before each call, this way you make sure that the grid is displaying the data with the sort and filter settings defined by the user.
Please let me know if you have any questions about this implementation.




Ramzi S
how the current page and pagination data are passed to the sefvice
The current page and page size can be passed as parameters to the service method that loads the data from the server. For example, you can have a method getPnl(page: number, pageSize: number) in your service that takes the current page and page size as parameters and uses them to fetch the data from the server.

Here is an example of how you might implement the service method:

Copy code
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
})
export class PnlService {
    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

    getPnl(page: number, pageSize: number) {
        return this.http



Ramzi S
i can't see in the component code how the page size and current page are passed to the dispatch
You're correct, in the code example that I provided earlier, the current page and page size were not passed to the dispatch action. One way to pass the current page and page size to the action is to include them as payload in the action.
Here is how you can add the current page and page size to the payload of the action:

Copy code
loadData() {
    this.store.dispatch(new LoadPnlData({currentPage: this.currentPage, pageSize: this.pageSize}));
    this.gridOptions.api.setSortModel(null);
    this.gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);
    this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = null;
}

loadAggregatedData() {
    this.store.dispatch(new LoadAggregatedPnlData({currentPage: this.currentPage, pageSize: this.pageSize}));
    this.gridOptions.api.setSortModel(null);
    this.gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);
    this.gridOptions.autoGroupColumnDef = {headerName: 'HMS Book', field: 'hmsBook'};
}
And in your actions, you can define a payload type that includes currentPage and pageSize

Copy code
export class LoadPnlData implements Action {
    readonly type = PnlActionTypes.LoadPnlData;

    constructor(public payload: { currentPage: number, pageSize: number }) {}
}
Then in your Effect, you can use this payload to pass it to your service method

Copy code
@Effect()
loadPnl$: Observable<Action> = this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(PnlActionTypes.LoadPnlData),
    switchMap(action => {
        return this.pnlService.getPnl(action.payload.currentPage, action.payload.pageSize).pipe(
            map(data => new LoadPnlDataSuccess({ data })),
            catchError(error => of(new LoadPnlDataFailure(error)))
        );
    })
);
Please let me know if you have any questions about this implementation.




Ramzi S
can you use patchState
Yes, you can use the store.pipe method to update the state using the patchState method.

Here's an example of how you might use patchState to update the current page and page size in the store:

Copy code
loadData() {
    this.store.dispatch(new UpdatePagination({currentPage: this.currentPage, pageSize: this.pageSize}));
    this.store.dispatch(new LoadPnlData());
}
And in your reducer, you can use the patchState method to update the currentPage and pageSize in the state:

Copy code
case PnlActionTypes.UpdatePagination:
    return {
        ...state,
        currentPage: action.payload.currentPage,
        pageSize: action.payload.pageSize
    };
Note that in this example, I'm dispatching two different actions: UpdatePagination and LoadPnlData , the first one is updating the currentPage and pageSize in the store and the second one is loading the data.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this implementation.




Ramzi S
i'm beginner in angular nxgs , can you explain for me the purpose of using action,selector ,effects ,dispatch ... in simple terms with analogies for example with the java spring world
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the purpose of using actions, selectors, effects, and dispatch in Angular with ngrx in simple terms, and how they relate to the Spring world.

Actions: In Angular with ngrx, actions are like events that are dispatched to notify the store that something has happened in the application, such as a user clicking a button or a server returning data. These events contain information about the event, such as the type of event and any data associated with the event. In Spring, you can think of actions as similar to sending a message on a message bus.

Selectors: In Angular with ngrx, selectors are like getters for the store, which allow you to retrieve specific pieces of data from the store, similar to how you might use a DAO to retrieve data from a database. Selectors can also be used to perform complex calculations on the data in the store, similar to how you might use a service in Spring to perform calculations on data before returning it to the client.

Effects: In Angular with ngrx, effects are like interceptors that listen for specific actions to be dispatched, and then perform some logic in response to those actions. For example, you might use an effect to listen for an action that requests data from a server, and then make an HTTP request to fetch that data. In Spring, you can think of effects as similar to using AOP to intercept certain method calls, and perform additional logic before or after the method is called.

Dispatch: In Angular with ngrx, the store.dispatch method is used to send an action to the store, similar to how you might use a message bus in Spring to send a message to a listener. Dispatching an action is the way to notify the store that something has happened in the application and the store will update the state accordingly.

Overall, the main purpose of using actions, selectors, effects and dispatch in Angular with ngrx is to help organize the logic of your application by separating different concerns.
Actions are used to notify the store of events, Selectors are used to retrieve data from the store, effects are used to perform logic in response to specific actions, and dispatch is used to send actions to the store. These concepts can help make your code more maintainable and easier to understand by separating the different concerns of your application.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details or examples.




Ramzi S
so actions are like events and dispatch will trigger the event?
Yes, that's correct! Actions in Angular with ngrx can be thought of as events that are dispatched to the store, and the store.dispatch method is used to trigger those events and send them to the store.

When an action is dispatched, the store will update its state based on the type of action and any data included in the action's payload. Then the effects or the reducer are listening to this event and will perform some logic in response to this event.

For example, if you have an action called LoadData and you dispatch this action, the store will know that this action is about loading data and it might call an effect that will make an HTTP request to fetch data from a server, or it might call the reducer that will update the state with the data.

In short, dispatching an action is the way to communicate with the store and notify it that something has happened and the store will take the appropriate actions.




Ramzi S
what is the purpose of the annotation @Action and the Annotation @State and how to use them 
In Angular with ngrx, the @Action and @State decorators are used to define actions and state, respectively.

@Action: This decorator is used to define an action class. An action class is a plain TypeScript class that describes an event that has occurred in the application, such as a user clicking a button or a server returning data. The @Action decorator is typically used in combination with the createAction function to define the type of the action and any additional metadata associated with the action.
Copy code
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';

export const loadData = createAction(
  '[Data] Load Data',
  props<{ data: any }>()
);
@State: This decorator is used to define the state of your application. The state is an interface or a class that describes the data that is stored in the store. The @State decorator is used in combination with the createFeatureSelector and createSelector functions to define the state's shape and to select specific data from the state.
Copy code
import { createFeatureSelector, createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';

export interface AppState {
  data: any[];
}

const selectData = createFeatureSelector<AppState>('data');

export const selectDataItems = createSelector(
  selectData,
  (state: AppState) => state.data
);
You can use these decorators in your app state to define your actions and state, in your reducer to handle the actions and in your effects to listen to the actions.
You can also use these selectors in your component to select the data from the store, the component will be updated automatically when the state changes.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you need




Ramzi S
you are talking about reducer , what reducer does?
A reducer is a pure function in Angular with ngrx that is responsible for updating the state of the application in response to actions that are dispatched to the store.

A reducer takes the current state of the application and an action as input, and it returns a new state that reflects the changes caused by the action. The reducer should not modify the existing state, instead it should create a new state object.

A typical reducer function might look like this:

Copy code
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { loadDataSuccess, loadDataFailure } from './data.actions';

export const initialState: any[] = [];

export const dataReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(loadDataSuccess, (state, { data }) => [...data]),
  on(loadDataFailure, state => [])
);
In this example, the dataReducer function is defined to handle two actions: loadDataSuccess and loadDataFailure. When the loadDataSuccess action is dispatched, the reducer updates the state by appending the data received in the action's payload to the current state. When the loadDataFailure action is dispatched, the reducer updates the state by returning an empty array.

The important thing to note is that the reducer is a pure function, meaning that it should not have side effects, and it should always return the same output for the same input. It just takes the current state, and action and return the new state.

This can be compared to the role of a controller in the Spring world, it receives the request and updates the model accordingly.
Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.

I have two components one for search that contains buttons and filters and one for ag grid . how to send page info from ag grid to search component. the loadPnlData in the search component actually is just doing "this.store.dispatch(new DisplayPnl());
There are several ways to pass page information from the ag-grid component to the search component, but one common approach is to use a shared service.

You can create a service that holds the current page and page size information, and this service can be injected into both the ag-grid component and the search component. The ag-grid component can update the page information in the service when the user navigates to a new page or changes the page size, and the search component can access the current page information from the




Ramzi S
without using service , ideally using nxgs
Yes, you can also pass the page information between the two components using ngrx store without using a shared service.

One approach is to include the current page and page size information in the store's state, and use the store's select method in the ag-grid component to access the current page information. The ag-grid component can then use the store.dispatch method to update the current page information in the store's state when the user navigates to a new page or changes the page size.

In the search component, you can use the select method to access the current page information from the store's state.

Here is an example of how you might implement this in your code:

Define the page information in the store's state:
Copy code
interface AppState {
  currentPage: number;
  pageSize: number;
}
In the ag-grid component, you can use the store.select method to access the current page information, and use the store.dispatch method to update it:
Copy code
this.store.select(selectCurrentPage).subscribe(currentPage => this.currentPage = currentPage);
this.store.select(selectPageSize).subscribe(pageSize => this.pageSize = pageSize);
Copy code
changePage(newPage: number) {
    this.store.dispatch(new UpdateCurrentPage(newPage));
}
In the search component, you can use the store.select method to access the current page information and pass it to the store.dispatch method when the user clicks on the DisplayPnl button:
Copy code
this.store.select(selectCurrentPage).subscribe(currentPage => this.currentPage = currentPage);
this.store.select(selectPageSize).subscribe(pageSize => this.pageSize = pageSize);
Copy code
loadPnlData() {
    this.store.dispatch(new DisplayPnl({currentPage: this.currentPage, pageSize: this.pageSize}));
}
This way you are passing page information from the ag-grid component to the search component using the store. The ag-grid component updates the page information in the store's state, and the search component accesses the current page information from the store's state to use it in the store.dispatch method.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need more details.

ok now how to pass the grouping request from ag grid 
In order to pass the grouping request from the ag-grid component to the search component using ngrx, you can use a similar approach as the one described before.

One approach is to include the grouping request in the store's state, and use the store's select method in the ag-grid component to access the current grouping request. The ag-grid component can then use the store.dispatch method to update the current grouping request in the store's state when the user changes the grouping request.

In the search component, you can use the store.select method to access the current grouping request from the store's state and pass it to the store.dispatch method when the user clicks on the Display Pnl Hms button.

Here's an example of how you might implement this:

Define the grouping request in the store's state:
Copy code
interface AppState {
  groupingBy: string;
}
In the ag-grid component, you can use the store.select method to access the current grouping request and use the store.dispatch method to update it:
Copy code
this.store.select(selectGroupingBy).subscribe(groupingBy => this.groupingBy = groupingBy);
Copy code
changeGrouping(groupBy: string) {
    this.store.dispatch(new UpdateGrouping(groupBy));
}
In the search component, you can use the store.select method to access the current grouping request and pass it to the store.dispatch method when the user clicks on the Display Pnl Hms button:
Copy code
this.store.select(selectGroupingBy).subscribe(groupingBy => this.groupingBy = groupingBy);
Copy code
loadPnlHmsData() {
    this.store.dispatch(new DisplayPnlHms({groupingBy: this.groupingBy}));
}
This way you are passing the grouping request from the ag-grid component to the search component using the store. The ag-grid component updates the grouping request in the store's state, and the search component accesses the current grouping request from the store's state to use it in the store.dispatch method.

You can also use an effect to handle this request and make the appropriate request to bigquery.

so what are the parameters that should be available in the spring controller ?
The parameters that should be available in the Spring controller will depend on the requirements of your application and the information that is needed to fulfill the request.

If you are using pagination, you will need to pass the current page number and page size to the controller. Also, if you are using grouping, you will need to pass the field on which the data should be grouped.

Here is an example of how your controller method might look like if it's handling pagination and grouping:

Copy code
@GetMapping("/pnl")
public ResponseEntity<Page<Map<String, String>>> getPnlData(
    @RequestParam(value = "page", defaultValue = "0") int page,
    @RequestParam(value = "size", defaultValue = "10") int size,
    @RequestParam(value = "groupBy", defaultValue = "hmsBook") String groupBy) {

    // retrieve paginated and grouped data from BigQuery
    Page<Map<String, String>> data = bigQueryService.getPnlData(page, size, groupBy);
    return new ResponseEntity<>(data, HttpStatus.OK);
}
You can also use other query parameters to filter the data, for example, date range, virtual portfolio selected, etc, and use them in the bigquery service to narrow the data retrieved.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.

the bigquery lib is returning a TableResult , how to achieve pagination using tableResult api and not directly on the sql query with limit and offset
When using the BigQuery API, pagination can be achieved by using the setStartIndex() and setMaxResults() methods on a QueryRequest object.

Here's an example of how you might use these methods to retrieve a specific page of results from a BigQuery table:

Copy code
BigQuery bigquery = createAuthorizedClient();

// Create a query request
String query = "SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable";
QueryRequest request = new QueryRequest().setQuery(query);

// Set the start index and max results for pagination
int pageSize = 100;
int pageNumber = 2;
int startIndex = (pageNumber - 1) * pageSize;
request.setStartIndex(startIndex).setMaxResults(pageSize);

// Execute the query
TableResult result = bigquery.jobs().query(request).execute();
In this example, we set the startIndex to be the page number minus 1 multiplied by the page size, and the maxResults to be the page size. This will retrieve the second page of results with 100 rows per page.

To avoid loading the entire dataset into memory, you can then iterate over the rows, and retrieve the rows that you need. For example:

Copy code
List<FieldValueList> rows = result.getRows();
for (FieldValueList row : rows) {
    System.out.println(row.toPrettyString());
}
This way, you will be able to paginate the data using the Bigquery API, and not by using limit and offset directly in the SQL query.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.

what is the best and the cleanest way to add grouping requests coming from the UI. the code should be easy to enhance in order to add new groupings other than hmsBook
There are several ways to handle grouping requests coming from the UI and add them to a BigQuery query, but one common approach is to use a Map to store the different groupings that are supported by the application.

Here's an example of how you might implement this in your code:

Define a Map in your service that maps groupBy keys to the corresponding BigQuery group by clause.
Copy code
private Map<String, String> groupings = new HashMap<>();

public BigQueryService() {
    groupings.put("hmsBook", "GROUP BY hmsBook");
    groupings.put("portfolioId", "GROUP BY portfolioId");
    // add other groupings here
}
In the controller, you can retrieve the grouping request and pass it to the service.
Copy code
@GetMapping("/pnl")
public ResponseEntity<Page<Map<String, String>>> getPnlData(
    @RequestParam(value = "page", defaultValue = "0") int page,
    @RequestParam(value = "size", defaultValue = "10") int size,
    @RequestParam(value = "groupBy", defaultValue = "hmsBook") String groupBy) {

    // retrieve paginated and grouped data from BigQuery
    Page<Map<String, String>> data = bigQueryService.getPnlData(page, size, groupBy);
    return new ResponseEntity<>(data, HttpStatus.OK);
}
In the service, you can use the Map to build the query and retrieve the data
Copy code
public Page<Map<String, String>> getPnlData(int page, int size, String groupBy) {
    // Build the query
    String query = "SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable";
    if (groupings.containsKey(groupBy)) {
        query += " " + groupings.get(groupBy);
    }
    // Execute the query and pagination
    // ...
    return data;
}



Ramzi S
how about the aggregations ,we should be able to sum all pnls when grouping. giving the fact that we have already a List that contains pnl measures column names
To add aggregation when grouping, you can use the SQL SUM function in the query. You can also use a similar approach as the one described for grouping, and use a Map to store the different aggregation functions that are supported by the application.

Here's an example of how you might implement this in your code:

Define a List in your service that contains the pnl measures column names
Copy code
private List<String> pnlMeasures = Arrays.asList("pnl1", "pnl2", "pnl3");
In the service, you can use the List to build the query and retrieve the data
Copy code
public Page<Map<String, String>> getPnlData(int page, int size, String groupBy) {
    // Build the query
    String query = "SELECT ";
    if (groupings.containsKey(groupBy)) {
        query += groupBy + ", ";
    }
    for (String measure : pnlMeasures) {
        query += "SUM(" + measure + ") as " + measure + ", ";
    }
    query = query.substring(0, query.length() - 2); // remove the last comma
    query += " FROM mydataset.mytable";
    if (groupings.containsKey(groupBy)) {
        query += " " + groupings.get(groupBy);
    }
    // Execute the query and pagination
    // ...
    return data;
}
This way, you are building the query by concatenating the group by clause, and the sum of pnl measures columns, based on the groupBy parameter passed by the user.

You can also use other aggregation functions like COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN and so on, and add them to the Map to make them available based on the user request.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.

make the sql query charged from a configuration bean class so that the sql can be changed in the application.yml file. Also ttry to make all bigquery operations in a class named BigQueryRepository , and all pnl related in another class PnlRepository that uses the BigQueryRepository
Here's an example of how you might implement this in your code:

Create a configuration bean class that holds the SQL query as a property and can be configured in the application.yml file.
Copy code
@Configuration
public class QueryConfig {
    @Value("${bigquery.query}")
    private String query;
    public String getQuery() {
        return query;
    }
}
In the application.yml, you can configure the query property
Copy code
bigquery:
  query: SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable
Create a BigQueryRepository class that will handle all the operations related to BigQuery
Copy code
@Repository
public class BigQueryRepository {
    private final BigQuery bigquery;
    private final QueryConfig queryConfig;

    public BigQueryRepository(BigQuery bigquery, QueryConfig queryConfig) {
        this.bigquery = bigquery;
        this.queryConfig = queryConfig;
    }

    public TableResult executeQuery(String query) {
        QueryRequest request = new QueryRequest().setQuery(query);
        return bigquery.jobs().query(request).execute();
    }
    // other operations
}
Create a PnlRepository class that uses the BigQueryRepository to retrieve the pnl data
Copy code
@Repository
public class PnlRepository {
    private final BigQueryRepository bigQueryRepository;
    private final QueryConfig queryConfig;
    private final List<String> pnlMeasures;
    private final Map<String, String> groupings;

    public PnlRepository(BigQueryRepository bigQueryRepository, QueryConfig queryConfig) {
        this.bigQueryRepository = bigQueryRepository;
        this.queryConfig = queryConfig;
        this.pnlMeasures = Arrays.asList("pnl1", "pnl2", "pnl3");
        this.groupings = new HashMap<>();
        groupings.put("hmsBook", "GROUP BY hmsBook");
        groupings.put("portfolioId", "GROUP BY portfolioId");
    }

    public Page<Map<String, String>> getPnlData(int page, int size, String groupBy) {
        // Build the query
        String query = queryConfig.getQuery();
        if (groupings.containsKey(groupBy)) {
            query += " " + groupings.get(groupBy);
        }
        for (String measure : pnlMeasures) {
            query += ", SUM(" + measure + ") as " + measure;
        }
        // Execute the query
        TableResult result = bigQueryRepository.executeQuery(query);
        //pagination and convert the result to Page<Map<String, String>>
        // ...
        return data;
    }
}
This way, the SQL query is loaded from the application

the pnl measures are fetched from a big query table named pnl_measures ,with an sql query select distinc pnlMeasure from ...
Here's an example of how you might implement this in your code:

In the PnlRepository class, you can add a method to retrieve the pnl measures from the bigquery table:
Copy code
    public List<String> getPnlMeasures() {
        String query = "SELECT DISTINCT pnlMeasure FROM mydataset.pnl_measures";
        TableResult result = bigQueryRepository.executeQuery(query);
        List<String> pnlMeasures = new ArrayList<>();
        for (TableRow row : result.getRows()) {
            pnlMeasures.add(row.getF().get(0).getV().toString());
        }
        return pnlMeasures;
    }
Call the method in the constructor of PnlRepository to retrieve the pnl measures and store them in an instance variable.
Copy code
    public PnlRepository(BigQueryRepository bigQueryRepository, QueryConfig queryConfig) {
        this.bigQueryRepository = bigQueryRepository;
        this.queryConfig = queryConfig;
        this.pnlMeasures = getPnlMeasures();
        this.groupings = new HashMap<>();
        groupings.put("hmsBook", "GROUP BY hmsBook");
        groupings.put("portfolioId", "GROUP BY portfolioId");
    }
You can now use the pnlMeasures variable in the getPnlData method to build the query and retrieve the data.

You may also want to consider caching the pnl measures to prevent querying the table every time the PnlRepository is instantiated.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.




Ramzi S
how to cache the pnlMeasures columns . If the getPnlMeasures is called from the constructor that means that those data are loaded once at the bean creation , since it is a singleton bean?
Caching the pnl measures can be done in several ways, depending on the specific requirements of your application. Here are a few options:

Using a caching framework such as EhCache, Guava or Caffeine. You can configure the cache to expire after a certain period of time and use the getPnlMeasures() method to retrieve the data from the cache if it's available, otherwise fetch it from the BigQuery table and store it in the cache.

Using Spring's @Cacheable annotation. You can use this annotation on the getPnlMeasures() method so that the result will be cached and returned from the cache on subsequent calls, instead of executing the method again.

Copy code
    @Cacheable(value = "pnlMeasures")
    public List<String> getPnlMeasures() {
        //...
    }
Using @ConfigurationProperties
Copy code
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "pnl")
public class PnlProperties {

    private List<String> measures;

    public List<String> getMeasures() {
        return measures;
    }

    public void setMeasures(List<String> measures) {
        this.measures = measures;
    }
}
then in your application.yml file

Copy code
pnl:
  measures:
    - pnl1
    - pnl2
    - pnl3
Using any of the above caching mechanism will prevent the need to query the table every time the PnlRepository is instantiated, and will improve the performance of your application.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.

can you add the unit tests for BigQueryRepository, PnlRepository and PnlService. I want the coverage above 80% , enhance the code to more respect SOLID principles
Sure, here's an example of how you might write unit tests for the BigQueryRepository, PnlRepository, and PnlService classes:

BigQueryRepositoryTest
Copy code
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class BigQueryRepositoryTest {

    @Mock
    private BigQuery bigquery;

    @Mock
    private QueryConfig queryConfig;

    @Mock
    private Jobs jobs;

    @Mock
    private QueryRequest queryRequest;

    @Mock
    private Job job;

    @Mock
    private TableResult tableResult;

    @InjectMocks
    private BigQueryRepository bigQueryRepository;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        when(bigquery.jobs()).thenReturn(jobs);
        when(jobs.query(queryRequest)).thenReturn(job);
        when(job.execute()).thenReturn(tableResult);
    }

    @Test
    public void testExecuteQuery() {
        // Given
        String query = "SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable";
        when(queryConfig.getQuery()).thenReturn(query);

        // When
        TableResult result = bigQueryRepository.executeQuery(query);

        // Then
        verify(bigquery).jobs();
        verify(jobs).query(queryRequest);
        verify(job).execute();
        assertEquals(tableResult, result);
    }
}
PnlRepositoryTest
Copy code
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class PnlRepositoryTest {

    @Mock
    private BigQueryRepository bigQueryRepository;

    @Mock
    private QueryConfig queryConfig;

    @Mock
    private TableResult tableResult;

    @InjectMocks
    private PnlRepository pnlRepository;

    @Test
    public void testGetPnlData() {
        // Given
        String query = "SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable GROUP BY hmsBook";
        when(queryConfig.getQuery()).thenReturn("SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable");
        when(bigQueryRepository.executeQuery(query)).thenReturn(tableResult);

        // When
        Page<Map<String, String>> data = pnlRepository.getPnlData(0, 10, "hmsBook");

        // Then
        verify(bigQueryRepository).executeQuery(query);
        assertNotNull(data);
    }
}
PnlServiceTest
Copy code
public class PnlServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private PnlRepository pnlRepository;

    @InjectMocks
    private PnlService pnlService;

    @Test
    public void testGetPnlData() {
        // Given
        Page<Map<String, String>> data =



Ramzi S
continue
Copy code
        Page.of(Collections.emptyList(), 0, 0, 0);
        when(pnlRepository.getPnlData(0, 10, "hmsBook")).thenReturn(data);

        // When
        Page<Map<String, String>> result = pnlService.getPnlData(0, 10, "hmsBook");

        // Then
        verify(pnlRepository).getPnlData(0, 10, "hmsBook");
        assertEquals(data, result);
    }
}
The above unit tests cover some basic functionality of the classes and it's methods, and it could be enhanced to cover more functionality and edge cases.

Additionally, you can use tools like Jacoco or Cobertura to measure the coverage of your unit tests and make sure that it's above 80%.

As for SOLID principles, You can check that each class have a single responsibility and that it's easy to understand and reason about. Also, you can check that the classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

Please let me know if you have any other question or if you need more details.

add more tests 
Sure, here are a few more tests that you might want to consider adding to the existing unit tests:

BigQueryRepositoryTest :
Test the case where the query execution throws an exception.
Test the case where the query returns no results.
Test the case where the query returns results but with different schema than expected.
PnlRepositoryTest :
Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with invalid page number or page size.
Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with invalid group by parameter.
Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with multiple group by parameter.
PnlServiceTest :
Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with invalid page number or page size.

Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with multiple group by parameter.
Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with multiple aggregation columns.
Test the case where the getPnlData method is called with no aggregation columns.
It's important to think about the different scenarios that your application might encounter and to test those scenarios with unit tests. This will help you ensure that your application is working as expected and that it's robust and easy to maintain.

    }
In simple terms:

Actions are like events, they represent an intent to change the state of the store.
Dispatch is used to trigger those events and notify the store that a new action is happening.
Selectors are used to select specific pieces of data from the store.
Effects are used to handle side effects, such as making API calls, when an action is dispatched.
Reducers are used to update the state of the store based on the action that was dispatched.
In the example of Spring, you can think of the store being like the service layer, with actions being like the methods in the service, and the state being like the data in the service. The selectors are like the getters in the service and the reducers are like the setters in the service.

Annotations like @Action and @State are used to decorate classes and methods that are part of the state management process, such as actions and reducers.

The use of these patterns help to make the code more organized, testable and maintainable.

do you remember how the virtual portfolio is mapped?
Yes, I remember that the virtual portfolios are mapped to real Sophis portfolios using a hierarchy represented by a Java class called RiskPortfolio. The class has the following fields:

String portfolioId: the identifier of the portfolio
Integer code: the code of the portfolio. When the code is 0, it means that it's just a virtual portfolio, and when the code is not 0, it means that it's related to a real Sophis portfolio.
Map<String, RiskPortfolio> childMap: a map that contains the child portfolios.
Map<String, RiskPortfolio> parentMap: a map that contains the parent portfolios.
When the user selects a virtual portfolio in the UI, the server-side maps this virtual portfolio to all the real Sophis portfolios and adapts the BigQuery query accordingly by traversing the hierarchy of the RiskPortfolio and its childMap or parentMap.

You can resolve the portfolioId and the parentPortfolioId that need to be under or equals to the portfolio passed in the user request by traversing the hierarchy map stored in cache using the portfolioId provided in the user request.

Please let me know if there is anything more that I can help you with.




Ramzi S
I want you to adapt the PnlService and PnlRepository to handle the the virtual portfolio. Suppose that we have a class PortfolioService that contains all the methods related to portfolio fetching and browsing , you don't have th show examples of code for that class.don't forget to include all other specfications (grouping , pagination , aggregation , list of PnlMeasures coming from a separated query...)
Sure, here is an example of how the PnlService and PnlRepository classes can be adapted to handle virtual portfolios:

PnlService:

Copy code
@Service
public class PnlService {

    private final PnlRepository pnlRepository;
    private final PortfolioService portfolioService;

    public PnlService(PnlRepository pnlRepository, PortfolioService portfolioService) {
        this.pnlRepository = pnlRepository;
        this.portfolioService = portfolioService;
    }

    public PnlData getPnlData(String virtualPortfolioId, int page, int pageSize, String groupBy, List<String> pnlMeasures) {
        List<String> realPortfolioIds = portfolioService.getRealPortfolioIds(virtualPortfolioId);
        return pnlRepository.getPnlData(realPortfolioIds, page, pageSize, groupBy, pnlMeasures);
    }
}
PnlRepository:

Copy code
@Repository
public class PnlRepository {

    private final BigQuery bigQuery;

    public PnlRepository(BigQuery bigQuery) {
        this.bigQuery = bigQuery;
    }

    public PnlData getPnlData(List<String> portfolioIds, int page, int pageSize, String groupBy, List<String> pnlMeasures) {
        // Build the query to fetch the PNL data, including filtering by portfolio IDs, pagination, grouping and aggregation
        String query = "SELECT portfolioId, " + groupBy + ", SUM(" + String.join(", SUM(", pnlMeasures) + ") FROM `myproject.mydataset.mytable` WHERE portfolioId IN UNNEST(@portfolioIds) GROUP BY portfolioId, " + groupBy + " LIMIT @pageSize OFFSET @page * @pageSize";

        // Set the query parameters
        QueryJobConfiguration queryConfig =
                QueryJobConfiguration.newBuilder(query)
                        .addNamedParameter("portfolioIds", QueryParameterValue.array(portfolioIds, String.class))
                        .addNamedParameter("page", QueryParameterValue.int64(page))
                        .addNamedParameter("pageSize", QueryParameterValue.int64(pageSize))
                        .build();

        // Execute the query and process the results
        TableResult result = bigQuery.query(queryConfig);
        // ... process the results and return a PnlData object
    }
}
This way, the PnlService class is responsible for calling the PortfolioService to get the list of real portfolio IDs that correspond to the virtual portfolio, and passing this list of IDs to the PnlRepository to fetch the PNL data. The PnlRepository then builds the query accordingly to filter the data by these portfolio IDs and return the results.

Regarding the pagination, the PnlRepository uses the LIMIT and OFFSET




Ramzi S
no we sayed that we will use TableResult to handle pagination , also the query should be separated in a Xonfig property bean
Yes, you're correct. If you want to handle pagination using the TableResult API, instead of using the LIMIT and OFFSET SQL keywords in the query, you can use the TableResult.getNextPage() method to retrieve the next page of data. Here's an example of how that would look like in the PnlRepository class:

Copy code
@Repository
public class PnlRepository {

    private final BigQuery bigQuery;
    private final PnlQueryConfig pnlQueryConfig;

    public PnlRepository(BigQuery bigQuery, PnlQueryConfig pnlQueryConfig) {
        this.bigQuery = bigQuery;
        this.pnlQueryConfig = pnlQueryConfig;
    }

    public PnlData getPnlData(List<String> portfolioIds, int page, int pageSize, String groupBy, List<String> pnlMeasures) {
        // Build the query to fetch the PNL data, including filtering by portfolio IDs, pagination, grouping and aggregation
        String query = pnlQueryConfig.getBaseQuery() + " WHERE portfolioId IN UNNEST(@portfolioIds) GROUP BY portfolioId, " + groupBy ;
        QueryJobConfiguration queryConfig =
                QueryJobConfiguration.newBuilder(query)
                        .addNamedParameter("portfolioIds", QueryParameterValue.array(portfolioIds, String.class))
                        .build();
        // Execute the query
        TableResult result = bigQuery.query(queryConfig);
        //process the result and return the PnlData
    }
}
Regarding the separation of the query, you can create a separate PnlQueryConfig bean that contains the query string as a property, and is loaded from the application.yml file.

Copy code
@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "pnl.query")
public class PnlQueryConfig {

    private String baseQuery;

    public String getBaseQuery() {
        return baseQuery;
    }

    public void setBaseQuery(String baseQuery) {
        this.baseQuery = baseQuery;
    }
}
Copy code

ok taking into account all what we have done in UI with ngxs,ag-grid ,states , and in the server , in the controller and the enhanced version of service and repository. When the user is displaying the grid with pnlData and chooses to add group by hms(with the mouse) , can you tell me the complete flow behind , which method or funtion will be triggered each time and in which componenent ,layer? 
Sure, here is an overview of the flow that would occur when the user chooses to group the PNL data by HMS in the AG-Grid:

In the AG-Grid component, the user clicks on the "Group by HMS" button or uses the context menu to group by HMS.
This action triggers the groupByHMS() method in the AG-Grid component.
Inside this method, the component dispatches an GroupByHms action using the store.dispatch() method.
The GroupByHms action is caught by the store's effects.
The effect that listens to the GroupByHms action is triggered, this effect will call the groupByHms method in the PnlService
Inside the groupByHms method, the service will call the getPnlDataGroupBy method in the PnlRepository
the getPnlDataGroupBy method in the PnlRepository will adjust the sql query to include the group by clause and call the BigQuery API to execute the query with the new clause.
The results from BigQuery are returned to the getPnlDataGroupBy method in the PnlRepository
The repository will process the results and return a PnlData object to the groupByHms method in the PnlService
The service will return the PnlData object to the effect
The effect will dispatch a new action that will update the state with the new data and groupByHms
the ag-grid component is connected to the state and will receive the new data and the groupByHms value, it will refresh the grid with this new data and apply the grouping using the value of groupByHms
That's the complete flow, as you can see it involves multiple layers and components to achieve this functionality. The UI component dispatches an action, which is handled by the store's effects, which then calls the service, which in turn calls the repository to fetch the data from BigQuery, then the repository processes the data and returns it to the service, which then returns it to the effect, which then dispatches an action to update the state, and the component receives the new state and updates the grid accordingly.




Ramzi S
what is required to add filtering on all columns and sorting
To add filtering and sorting capabilities to the AG-Grid, you'll need to make a few changes to your code.

In the AG-Grid component, you will need to enable filtering and sorting by setting the appropriate properties on the grid options. For example, you can enable filtering by setting the enableFilter property to true, and enable sorting by setting the enableSorting property to true.

You will also need to configure the columns in the AG-Grid so that they support filtering and sorting. You can do this by setting the filter and sortable properties on each column definition.

In the server-side, you'll need to update the query in the PnlRepository to include filtering and sorting. You can do this by adding WHERE clauses to filter the data based on the values entered by the user, and ORDER BY clauses to sort the data based on the column and direction selected by the user.

In the PnlService, you'll need to include parameters for filtering and sorting in the method and pass them to the Repository, also you can use the ngxs-query library to make easier the filtering and sorting.

The UI component will dispatch actions to filter and sort the data, these actions will be handled by the store effects which will call the service method passing the filter and sort parameters.

The service will call the repository passing the filter and sort parameters and the repository will use these parameters to adjust the query and call the Bigquery API

The Bigquery API will return the filtered and sorted data and the repository will return it to the service

The service will return the data to the effect which will dispatch an action to update the state

The ag-grid component is connected to the state and will receive the new data and will refresh the grid with this new data and apply the filtering and sorting accordingly.

Please note that the example I provided above is a general one and will require you to adjust it to your specific use case and the technologies you are using.




Ramzi S
having the date , the virtual portfolio , the pageSize , the page number , the group , the aggregations , the filters to the controller parameters are not too much? what is the best way to do that
Having a large number of parameters in the controller method can make the code more complex and harder to understand. One way to simplify the code and make it more readable is to use a DTO (Data Transfer Object) to encapsulate all of the query parameters. This way, instead of having a large number of individual parameters in the controller method, you can pass a single DTO object that contains all of the query parameters.

Here is an example of how this could be done:

Create a new class called PnlQueryDTO to represent the query parameters. It can have properties for date, virtual portfolio, page size, page number, group, aggregations, and filters.

In the controller method, update the method signature to accept a single PnlQueryDTO parameter instead of multiple individual parameters

In the PnlService, update the method to accept a single PnlQueryDTO parameter instead of multiple individual parameters.

In the PnlRepository, update the method to accept a single PnlQueryDTO parameter instead of multiple individual parameters.

In the UI component, create a new instance of PnlQueryDTO object to store the query parameters and pass it to the store.dispatch method.

The effect will call the service passing the PnlQueryDTO

The service will call the repository passing the PnlQueryDTO

The repository will use the PnlQueryDTO to adjust the query and call the Bigquery API

This approach has the advantage of making the code more readable, because all of the query parameters are encapsulated in a single object, and it also allows you to add new query parameters more easily by simply adding new properties to the PnlQueryDTO.

Additionally, you can use a library like class-validator to validate the PnlQueryDTO and make sure that the parameters passed are correct.

Please note that the example I provided above is a general one and will require you to adjust it to your specific use case and the technologies you are using.

are there any libs or api that facilitates the groupign,pagination, sorting ,filtering in BiQuery with java? those requirements are very commons.If there are no libs ,how can my code be reusable for those features?
There are several libraries and APIs available that can help with grouping, pagination, sorting, and filtering in BigQuery with Java. Here are a few examples:

The BigQuery Java client library provided by Google is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with the BigQuery API using Java. The library provides a Java client for the BigQuery API that you can use to perform various operations, including running queries, loading data, and managing datasets and tables. The library also supports pagination, sorting, and filtering using the setMaxResults, setOrderBy, and setFilter methods respectively.

The BigQuery Java client library provided by Apache Beam is another powerful tool that allows you to perform data processing and querying using Java. It provides a high-level API for running BigQuery SQL queries, and also supports pagination, sorting and filtering.

The BigQuery Java client library provided by Spring Data BigQuery is a Spring Data module for BigQuery that provides a convenient programming model for BigQuery based on Spring's Repository abstraction. it's allow to use pagination, sorting and filtering based on the spring data repository.

Jooq (Java Object-Relational Mapping) library is a powerful SQL generation and execution library that can be used to interact with BigQuery. It supports pagination, sorting and filtering using the built-in limit(), orderBy(), and where() methods respectively.

In order to make your code reusable for those features, you can create a general and abstract class/interface that contains methods for pagination, sorting, filtering, and grouping. This class/interface should contain methods with specific signatures, like findAll(Pageable pageable), findAll(Sort sort), findAll(Filter filter), and findAll(Group group).

Then, you can create a specific implementation of this class/interface that will use one of the libraries that I've mentioned above, and use it in your application. This way, if you decide to switch to another library in the future, you'll only have to change the implementation of your class/interface, without affecting the rest of your code.

Please note that the example I provided above is a general one and will require you to adjust it to your specific use case and the technologies you are using.

the portfolio list in the where condition 'WHERE portfolioId IN UNNEST(@portfolioIds)' is huge.I think about putting all portfolios and virtual portfolios mapping logic to a bigquery. table is it a good idea? what are the steps to achieve that
Putting the portfolios and virtual portfolios mapping logic in a BigQuery table can be a good idea if you have a large number of portfolios and the mapping logic is complex. This approach would allow you to offload some of the processing to BigQuery, which can handle large amounts of data and complex queries efficiently.

Here are the general steps you could take to achieve this:

Create a new BigQuery table that will store the mapping information. The table should have at least two columns: one for the portfolio ID and one for the virtual portfolio ID (if it exists).

Load the mapping information into the table. You can do this by running an insert statement in BigQuery, or by using a tool like Dataflow or Dataproc to load the data from a CSV file.

Update the query in your controller to join the mapping table with the Pnl table. This way, you can use the virtual portfolio ID in the WHERE clause instead of the portfolio ID.

Update the client side to pass the virtual portfolio ID instead of the portfolio ID

Update the mapping table regularly to keep it up-to-date.

You can create a view on top of the mapping table that contains only the virtual portfolio and the portfolio to make the query more efficient

Please note that the example I provided above is a general one and will require you to adjust it to your specific use case and the technologies you are using. Also, you should consider the cost of running this query and the cost of storing the mapping table.




Ramzi S
so i will have one table or two.? One column should be the virtual portfolio , but what about the sophis portfolios ids . also we should keep the mapping between parent portfolios and child one. if we have a virtual portfolio EQD and two other virtual portfolios EQD Paris and EQD London. those two virtual portfolios are mapped to a sophis Id, which in its turn may have children sophis ids
It depends on your specific use case, but in general it could make sense to have two separate tables to store the mapping information: one table for the virtual portfolios and another table for the Sophis portfolios.

The virtual portfolio table would contain at least two columns: one for the virtual portfolio ID, and one for the Sophis portfolio ID that it maps to. You could also include additional columns for the virtual portfolio name, hierarchy level, and any other relevant information.

The Sophis portfolio table would contain at least two columns: one for the Sophis portfolio ID, and one for the parent Sophis portfolio ID (if it exists). You could also include additional columns for the Sophis portfolio name, hierarchy level, and any other relevant information.

You could also include a third table to map the relationship between parent and child portfolios, this table would contain the parent_id and child_id.

This way, you would be able to use the virtual portfolio ID to join the virtual portfolio table with the Sophis portfolio table to get the Sophis portfolio ID, and then join the Sophis portfolio table with itself to get the parent Sophis portfolio ID. This approach would allow you to maintain the flexibility of having a virtual portfolio hierarchy while still being able to map it to the Sophis portfolio hierarchy.

Please note that this approach would require you to load and maintain three separate tables, it's important to consider the cost and the complexity of maintaining this mapping and if it's worth doing this, you should also consider the performance of the queries that you will use to join those three tables.




Ramzi S
what is more complex ,to handle that in biQuery or in the java code in memory?
Handling the portfolio and virtual portfolio mapping in BigQuery can be more complex than handling it in Java code in memory because it requires you to maintain and update multiple tables, and also to write complex queries to join those tables.

BigQuery is a powerful tool for handling large amounts of data and complex queries, but it can be more challenging to set up and maintain. On the other hand, handling the mapping in Java code in memory allows for more flexibility in terms of data structures and algorithms, but it may not be as efficient for large amounts of data and complex queries.

Handling the mapping in memory will also allow you to use the virtual portfolio Id instead of the Sophis portfolio Id, so you don't need to join tables to get the correct portfolio to filter on.

It's important to consider the specific requirements of your application and the scale of the data you will be working with when making this decision. If your data set is small and the mapping is simple, handling it in Java code in memory might be the best option. If your data set is large and the mapping is complex, it might be better to handle it in BigQuery.

It's also worth noting that with BigQuery, you can use the caching feature, and that could speed up the query execution.




Ramzi S
so let's say that we will handle it in bigquey. what the query would be like , if  I recieve a virtual portfolio EQD , and  I want to display all related pnlMeasures and will be able in the Gui to navigate through the virtual portfolio grouping ( I exapnd EQD il will display EQD paris and EQD london, if i expand EQD london ,  I will get all the pnls related to this virtual portfolio)
If you're handling the portfolio and virtual portfolio mapping in BigQuery, you would need to write a query that joins the virtual portfolio table with the Sophis portfolio table to get the Sophis portfolio ID for the virtual portfolio ID passed in the request. Then, you would join the Sophis portfolio table with the PnL measures table to get the PnL measures for the Sophis portfolio ID.

Here is an example of what the query might look like:

Copy code
WITH virtual_portfolio AS (
  SELECT virtual_portfolio_id, sophis_portfolio_id
  FROM virtual_portfolio_table
  WHERE virtual_portfolio_id = 'EQD'
),
sophis_portfolio AS (
  SELECT sophis_portfolio_id, parent_sophis_portfolio_id
  FROM sophis_portfolio_table
  JOIN virtual_portfolio
    ON virtual_portfolio.sophis_portfolio_id = sophis_portfolio_table.sophis_portfolio_id
),
sophis_portfolio_with_ancestors AS (
  WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
    SELECT * FROM sophis_portfolio
    UNION ALL
    SELECT sp.* FROM sophis_portfolio sp
    JOIN cte
    ON sp.sophis_portfolio_id = cte.parent_sophis_portfolio_id
  )
  SELECT * FROM cte
)
SELECT pnl_measures.*
FROM sophis_portfolio_with_ancestors
JOIN pnl_measures
ON pnl_measures.sophis_portfolio_id = sophis_portfolio_with_ancestors.sophis_portfolio_id
This query uses a recursive common table expression (CTE) to get all ancestors of the Sophis portfolio ID returned from the join with the virtual portfolio table.

It's important to note that this is just an example and that it assumes that the virtual_portfolio_table, sophis_portfolio_table and pnl_measures table exist and that they contain the columns specified in the query. This query will return all the Pnl measures for the virtual portfolio and all its children virtual portfolio that are mapped to Sophis portfolios.

You can then group the results by hmsBook in the client side by using ag-grid tree map, you can also use the function GROUP BY in the BigQuery to group by the hmsBook and use the function SUM() to get the sum of pnl measures.

how to achieve the display all related pnlMeasures and will be able in the Gui to navigate through the virtual portfolio grouping ( I exapnd EQD il will display EQD paris and EQD london, if i expand EQD london ,  I will get all the pnls related to this virtual portfolio)
To achieve displaying all related PnL measures and being able to navigate through the virtual portfolio grouping in the GUI, you can use the ag-grid's tree data feature. This feature allows you to display the data in a hierarchical tree structure and allows you to group the data by a certain column.

In your case, you can group the data by the virtual portfolio column, and then by the child virtual portfolio column. When a user expands the EQD virtual portfolio, it will display the EQD Paris and EQD London virtual portfolios, and when the user expands EQD London, it will display all the PnL measures related to that virtual portfolio.

You can achieve this in your code by following these steps:

In your component, set the grid's groupUseEntireRow to true and groupSuppressAutoColumn to true. This will allow you to control the columns that are used for grouping and display the group column in its own row.
Define your virtual portfolio column as the first column in your column definition and set the rowGroup and hide property to true. This will make it the first column in the grid and hide it while still used for grouping
Define your child virtual portfolio column as the second column in your column definition and set the rowGroup property to true. This will make it the second column in the grid and will be used for grouping the child virtual portfolio
In your data, make sure that the virtual portfolio and child virtual portfolio values match the values in the column definition.
In your component, set the grid's enableSorting and enableFilter property to true to allow users to sort and filter the data by any column.
Also you can use nxgs state and action to handle the expand and collapse events.
You can dispatch an action when a user expands or collapses a group, and in your state management, you can add a property that keeps track of the expanded groups and use it to filter the data that's displayed in the grid.




Ramzi S
how many service call comibnation I will have
The number of service call combinations will depend on the specific implementation of your application.

In general, you will need to make at least one service call to retrieve the data from BigQuery, with the specific query parameters depending on the user's selections in the UI. The parameters that you need to pass to the service can include:

virtual portfolio: to retrieve the data related to the specific virtual portfolio selected by the user
page size and page number: to handle pagination
group by: to group the data by a specific column, in this case, the hmsBook column
aggregations: to sum the pnl measures
filters: to filter the data based on the user's inputs
Additionally, you may need to make another service call to retrieve the list of pnl measures columns.

You will also need to make a service call to retrieve the virtual portfolio hierarchy and mapping between virtual portfolio and real portfolio.

You may also need to make additional service calls to handle other features such as sorting and filtering, but this will depend on the specifics of your implementation.

You can also use a cache mechanism to store the hierarchy and mapping between virtual and real portfolios so you don't have to make service call each time you need it.




Ramzi S
at his stage I have all the components and backend server implementation but without pagination and by doing grouping and aggregation by ag-grid. What are the steps to add pagination , filters , grouping and aggregation in my project?
Here are the general steps you can take to add pagination, filtering, grouping, and aggregation in your project:

Pagination:
In the backend, you will need to modify the query to limit the number of returned rows according to the page size and page number parameters passed in the request. Bigquery provides method to paginate the results using setPageSize and setPageToken methods.
In the frontend, you will need to add the pagination controls to the UI, such as page size selector and page navigation buttons. You can use the ag-grid's built-in pagination support or you can handle it manually by using the page size and page number parameters to limit the data displayed in the grid.
Filtering:
In the backend, you will need to modify the query to filter the data according to the filtering parameters passed in the request. You can use the WHERE clause in your query to filter the data.
In the frontend, you will need to add the filtering controls to the UI, such as filter inputs for each column. You can use the ag-grid's built-in filtering support or you can handle it manually by using the filter parameters to filter the data before passing it to the grid.
Grouping:
In the backend, you will need to modify the query to group the data according to the grouping parameter passed in the request. You can use the GROUP BY clause in your query to group the data.
In the frontend, you will need to allow the user to select the column they want to group by and add the ag-grid's built-in grouping support to handle it.
Aggregation:
In the backend, you will need to modify the query to aggregate the data according to the aggregation parameters passed in the request. You can use the aggregate functions such as SUM or COUNT in your query to aggregate the data.
In the frontend, you will need to allow the user to select the columns they want to aggregate and add the ag-grid's built-in aggregation support to handle it.
It's important to notice that you will need to keep track of the state of the grid (pagination, filtering, grouping, and aggregation) and keep it consistent between the client and the server by passing the right parameters to the service calls.
